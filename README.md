# üê∑ GIP Scripts

Some time ago, I created [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm) package named [GIP](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gip), which is a simple [JavaScript](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) [module](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules) and [CLI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) tool that checks external [IPv4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4) address of the machine it runs on. Now I want to create a few scripts in different programming languages that will do the same thing. 

These scripts will do the following:

- Do a parallel HTTP request to the multiple services that return the IP address.
- Ensure that the IP address is real by waiting for at least three the same responses.

## Usage

You can grab the scripts from the root directory of the repository.

You can pass `--ensure N` argument to specify the number of the same responses (default is 3).  
Keep in mind that currently there is 28 services, so do not pass the number greater than 28.

### [BASH](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/)

./gip.sh
./gip.sh --ensure 10
```

### [Python](https://www.python.org/)

```bash
python gip.py
python gip.py --ensure 10
```

### [Bun](https://bun.sh/)
  
```bash
bun gip.ts
bun gip.ts --ensure 10
```

### [Deno](https://deno.com/)

```bash
deno --allow-net gip.ts
deno --allow-net gip.ts --ensure 10
```
